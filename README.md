# KvYaru-Colors
Kvantum themes to match the [Yaru colors](https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors) and https://github.com/Muqtxdir/yaru-remix themes!

Light themes are forked from [KvYaru](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/tree/master/Kvantum/themes/kvthemes/KvYaru). Dark themes are forked from [KvGnomeDark](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/tree/master/Kvantum/themes/kvthemes/KvGnomeDark).

Themes come in light and dark variants depending on whether the Qt theme is set to "kvantum" or "kvantum-dark."
